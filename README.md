# DeepLearning_Tensorflow
This repo is for practicing deep learning algorithms using Tensorflow and Keras. 

## Project details

- **dogs_vs_cats:** Dogs vs. Cats classification project using keras and tensorflow. To monitor training tensorboard is used. Model can be learned from scratch or using transfer learning. Class activation maps is implemented to visulize the focus of  the convolutional layers. 
- **dogs_breeds:** Diffrent dogs breeds classifcation project using only tensorflow. 
- **dogs_cats_breeds:** The goal of this project is to build a model that shares the convolutional laypers to produce two outputs: dogs and cats classification and dogs breeds classifcaion. Each classification uses its own loss function.
- **imdb_sentiment_analysis:** A sentiment analaysis project on IMDB movie reviews using word embbeding and RNN.
