# DeepLearning_Tensorflow
This repo is for practicing deep learning algorithms using Tensorflow and Keras. 

## Project details

- **dogs_vs_cats:** Dogs vs. Cats classification project using keras and tensorflow. To monitor training tensorboard is used. The model can be learned from scratch or using transfer learning. Class activation maps are implemented to visualize the focus of  the convolutional layers. 
- **dogs_breeds:** Different dogs breeds classifcation project using only tensorflow (not Keras). 
- **dogs_cats_breeds:** The goal of this project is to build a model with two outputs that shares the convolutional layers. The outputs of the models are dogs and cats classification and dogs breeds classifcaion. Each classification uses its own loss function.
- **imdb_sentiment_analysis:** A sentiment analaysis project on IMDB movie reviews using word embbeding and RNN.
