# DeepLearning_Tensorflow
This repo is for practicing deep learning algorithms using Tensorflow and Keras. 

## Project details

- **dogs_vs_cats:** Dogs vs. Cats classification project using keras and tensorflow. To monitor training tensorboard is used. The model can be learned from scratch or using transfer learning. Class activation maps are implemented to visualize the focus of  the convolutional layers. 
- **imdb_sentiment_analysis:** is a simple chatbot application based on naive bayes bag of words representation of words.  
- **input_pipeline:** building an data pipeline using tensorflow tf.data to classify images of cats and dogs.
