The dataset can be downloaded for free from the Kaggle website, although I believe you must have a Kaggle account.

If you do not have a Kaggle account, sign-up first.

Download the dataset by visiting the Dogs vs. Cats Data page and click the “Download All” button.

This will download the 850-megabyte file “dogs-vs-cats.zip” to your workstation.

Unzip the file and you will see train.zip, train1.zip and a .csv file. Unzip the train.zip file, as we will be focusing only on this dataset.
